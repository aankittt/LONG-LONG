#include <iostream>

int main() {
    LongLong a = "123456789012345678901234567890";
    LongLong b = "987654321098765432109876543210";
    
    LongLong sum = a + b;
    LongLong product = a * b;
    
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Product: " << product << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
